Let‚Äôs dive into the **"What happens next?"** panel in n8n, as shown in your image. This panel appears after you‚Äôve added a trigger node (like "On Form Submission" or "Webhook") to your workflow, prompting you to decide the next step in your automation. It‚Äôs a key part of building workflows in n8n, helping you choose what actions or logic to add after the trigger starts the workflow. I‚Äôll explain this concept in a beginner-friendly way, break down each option in detail, provide examples, and include real-world use cases. Let‚Äôs make it engaging with clear headings and examples!

## üöÄ Understanding the "What Happens Next?" Panel in n8n

The **"What happens next?"** panel in n8n is a menu that appears after you‚Äôve set up a trigger node in your workflow. It‚Äôs like a roadmap for your automation: the trigger (e.g., "On Form Submission") starts the workflow, and this panel helps you decide what should happen afterward. You can add nodes to perform actions, transform data, control the flow, or even add another trigger.

Think of it as planning a party: the trigger is the invitation that gets the party started (e.g., guests arriving), and the "What happens next?" panel lets you decide what activities come next‚Äîlike playing music, serving food, or taking photos.

## üåü How the "What Happens Next?" Panel Fits into a Workflow

This panel is the bridge between your trigger and the actions in your workflow. After the trigger starts the workflow (e.g., a form submission), you use this panel to decide what happens next‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs saving data, sending a notification, or adding logic. For example:
- **Workflow**:
  - **Trigger**: "On Form Submission" collects user data.
  - **What Happens Next?**: Add an "Action in an App" node (Google Sheets) to save the data, then a "Flow" node (If) to check if the user is a VIP, and finally an "Action in an App" node (Email) to send a thank-you.
- **Connection to Settings**: The "Error Workflow" setting can handle failures in any of these steps.
