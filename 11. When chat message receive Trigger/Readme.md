# 11. When chat message receive Trigger

Let‚Äôs dive into the **When Chat Message Received** trigger node in n8n, as shown in your image. This is a specific type of trigger we discussed earlier, categorized under "On Chat Message," where the workflow starts when a user sends a message in a chat interface created by n8n. I‚Äôll break this down in a beginner-friendly way, explain each part in detail, provide examples, and include real-world use cases. To make it engaging, I‚Äôll use headings with icons and structure the content clearly!

## üöÄ Understanding the When Chat Message Received Trigger in n8n

The **When Chat Message Received** trigger in n8n allows you to create a simple chat interface within n8n, share it with users, and start a workflow whenever someone sends a message in the chat. It‚Äôs like setting up a chatbot on your website: you provide a link for users to access the chat, and when they send a message, n8n captures it and triggers a workflow to respond or process the message.

Think of it as a friendly assistant: you set up a chat window where users can talk to your automation, and n8n listens for their messages to take action‚Äîlike answering questions, logging inquiries, or even integrating with AI to provide smart responses.

## üß© Breakdown of the When Chat Message Received Trigger Node

The image shows the configuration panel for the When Chat Message Received node, with tabs for **Parameters**, **Settings**, and **Docs**. The **Parameters** tab is active, and it includes fields like Chat URL, Make Chat Publicly Available, Mode, Authentication, Initial Message(s), and Options. Let‚Äôs break each part down step-by-step.

### üåê 1. Chat URL
- **What it is**: This is the URL where users can access the chat interface.
- **Value**: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/c44a60e3-5499-476b-abbb-5a6d364199fe/chat`
- **What it does**: 
  - This URL is the link to the chat page that n8n generates.
  - Share this URL with users, and they can open it in a browser to start chatting.
- **How it works**:
  - n8n creates this URL automatically when you add the When Chat Message Received node.
  - The chat becomes live once you save and activate the workflow (using the "Inactive" toggle).
- **Example**: You copy the Chat URL and send it to a friend. They open it, see a chat window, and type ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù‚Äîtriggering your workflow.
- **Real-World Use**: A small business shares the Chat URL on their website for customers to ask questions.
- **Why use it?**: It provides an easy way for users to interact with your automation via a chat interface.

### üîì 2. Make Chat Publicly Available
- **What it is**: A toggle to control whether the chat is accessible to everyone.
- **Options**: On (green, selected in your image) or Off.
- **What it does**:
  - **On**: Anyone with the Chat URL can access the chat (public).
  - **Off**: The chat is private and requires authentication to access.
- **How it works**:
  - With "On," the chat is open to anyone who has the URL.
  - If turned "Off," you‚Äôd need to set up authentication (e.g., a password) to restrict access.
- **Example**: You set it to "On" for a public support chat. Customers visit the URL and start chatting without logging in.
- **Real-World Use**: A nonprofit sets the chat to "On" for a public Q&A session during a fundraiser.
- **Why use it?**: It makes the chat accessible to a wider audience, which is great for public-facing interactions.

### üì° 3. Mode
- **What it is**: This dropdown sets the type of chat interaction.
- **Options**: 
  - **Hosted Chat** (selected in your image).
  - Other options might include "Embedded Chat" (depending on the n8n version).
- **What it does**:
  - **Hosted Chat**: n8n hosts the chat at the Chat URL, and users visit that URL to interact.
  - **Embedded Chat**: The chat can be embedded into a website (e.g., as a widget), but this requires additional setup.
- **How it works**:
  - With "Hosted Chat," users go to the provided URL to chat.
  - The note below says: ‚ÄúChat will be live at the URL above once you activate this workflow. Live executions will show up in the ‚Äòexecutions‚Äô tab.‚Äù
- **Example**: You choose "Hosted Chat" and share the URL with your team. They open it and start chatting with the bot.
- **Real-World Use**: A customer support team uses "Hosted Chat" for a dedicated support channel.
- **Why use it?**: It‚Äôs the simplest way to set up a chat interface without needing to embed it in a website.

### üîí 4. Authentication
- **What it is**: This determines if users need to log in or provide credentials to access the chat.
- **Options**: Dropdown with choices like "None" (selected in your image), "Basic Auth," or "Header Auth."
- **What it does**:
  - **None**: Anyone with the URL can access the chat (no security).
  - **Basic Auth**: Requires a username and password to access the chat.
  - **Header Auth**: Requires a specific key in the request headers (advanced).
- **How it works**:
  - With "None," the chat is open to everyone.
  - With authentication enabled, only authorized users can access the chat.
- **Example**: You set Authentication to "None" for a public FAQ chat. For an internal team chat, you might use "Basic Auth" to restrict access.
- **Real-World Use**: A company uses "Basic Auth" for an employee-only chat to discuss project updates.
- **Why use it?**: It adds security, protecting the chat from unauthorized access when needed.

### üí¨ 5. Initial Message(s)
- **What it is**: This is the first message(s) the chat displays to users when they open it.
- **Value**: ‚ÄúHi there! üëã My name is Nathan. How can I assist you today?‚Äù (in your image).
- **What it does**: It sets a welcoming message to greet users and guide them on what to do.
- **How it works**:
  - Enter one or more messages in the text box.
  - When a user opens the chat, they see this message as the starting point of the conversation.
- **Example**: You set the initial message to ‚ÄúWelcome to our support chat! How can I help you?‚Äù Users see this when they start the chat.
- **Real-World Use**: An online store uses ‚ÄúHello! Need help with your order? Ask away!‚Äù to encourage customers to ask questions.
- **Why use it?**: It makes the chat friendly and gives users a clear starting point, improving their experience.

### üîß 6. Options (Parameters Tab)
- **What it is**: This section lets you add extra parameters to customize the chat‚Äôs behavior.
- **Options**: "No properties" (default), with an "Add Field" button.
- **What it does**: You can add advanced settings, like custom styling or behavior, for the chat.
- **How it works**: Click "Add Field" to add options like "Chat Title" or "Theme."
- **Example**: You add a field "Chat Title" with value "Support Chat" to display a custom title on the chat window.
- **Real-World Use**: A developer adds a "Theme" field to change the chat‚Äôs colors to match their brand.
- **Why use it?**: It provides flexibility to customize the chat‚Äôs appearance or functionality.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Options (Settings Tab)
The **Settings** tab (shown in the second image) provides additional configuration options for the chat. Let‚Äôs break these down:

- **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: 
  - **What it is**: Controls which websites can embed the chat (if using Embedded Chat mode).

## üåü How the When Chat Message Received Trigger Fits into a Workflow

- **Workflow**:
  - **Trigger**: When Chat Message Received.
  - **Next Node**: A node checks the message and responds (e.g., using a "Send Message" node).
- **Connection to Settings**: The "Error Workflow" setting can handle cases where the chat fails to process a message.
